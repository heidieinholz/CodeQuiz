# CodeQuiz

##Instructions
Test your knowledge with this code quiz! Answer each question by clicking on the correct answer button. The faster you answer, the higher your score. Wrong answers detract by your time (and score) by 10 seconds/points. Enter your initials to see if you got a high score!

**Note, the high score function is not working in this example. Scores are entered into localStorage but I can't get them onto the page. ;-(
